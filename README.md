Javier Gat√≥n's personal webpage.

In this webpage I will show some information about myself and some of my projects.

A regular jekyll webpage, with the additional feature of supporting the usage of custom tags for the projects,
which are a custom data type stored in YAML files (both tags and projects).
It also lets the user filter the projects based on the tags.
