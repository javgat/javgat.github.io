<h3 class="m-3">Who am I?</h3>
I'm Javier Gatón Herguedas, a young computer engineer interested in scientific research.

Take a look at my [Curriculum-vitae][curriculum-url-en]! You can also check the [spanish version][curriculum-url-es].

I graduated in computer engineering, minoring in software engineering at the Universidad de Valladolid in 2021.

I like music, and I studied piano from 7 to 18 years old, finishing the Professional degree
at the Valladolid Professional Conservatory in 2018.

    <p>
        I enjoyed the time spent studying at University of Valladolid (UVa), surrounded by great classmates, and being taught by very proficient computer scientists, engineers and researchers, that in some cases were really good teachers.
    </p>
    <p>
        While studying at the Universidad de Valladolid I took part in different activities, being these the most notable ones:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Mentor of first-year students at the 2018 and 2019 University of Valladolid Programming Gymkhanas.</li>
        <li>I was a member of the GUI (Grupo Universitario de Informática), where I taught workshops like the <a href="https://www.inf.uva.es/en/2019/03/28/taller-de-terminal-en-linux/">Linux Console Workshop 2019</a>.</li>
        <li>Taught courses at the Hour Of Code, like the <a href="https://github.com/HylianPablo/TallerC_HoC2020">introductory and intermediate <b>C</b> courses at Hour of Code 2020</a>.</li>
        <li>Since I underperformed in algorithmics, I Joined UVaCoders (Competitive Algorithmics Team) in order to hone my skills. With them I took part in multiples coding contest, namely multiple editions of the Cloudflight/Catalysts Coding Contest using <b>Python</b>, <b>C</b> and <b>Java</b>.</li>
        <li>Member of the directive committee of the first regional olympiad in informatics, <a href="https://www.inf.uva.es/en/2021/02/01/celebrada-la-1a-olimpiada-informatica-de-castilla-y-leon/">OICyL 2021</a>.</li>
    </ul>

        After ending up as a <a href="https://www.inf.uva.es/en/2021/10/04/finalista-en-la-seleccion-de-proyectos-del-xvi-observatorio-tecnologico-hp-2021/">finalist</a> for best undergraduate thesis project with HP SCDS, for <a href="https://github.com/javgat/UVA-DevTest">UVA-DevTest</a>, I got offered a job at HP's Hub in Leon.
    </p>
    <p>
        Working at HP SCDS was a great experience that showed me what was a real software engineering/developer job. It was a great place were I met coworkers and managers from whom I learned a lot.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although I had a great time, the time here also showed me that my true vocation was research and teaching.
